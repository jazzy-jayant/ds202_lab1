#Arlena Wang, arlenaw
The instructor converted the file README, updated the file and then converted it to README.md

First, the instructor created "README" with the ID: 5b20e6e3c657e5a6e6ab1c99d28e84b9efc78366

Then, the instructor updated "README" with the ID:7958af1beeaf537c8136cda7b4d1f2bc5e806550

Finally, the instructor renamed "README" to "README.md" with the ID:5dd17cef356f30b711ed27eb24a99071d2a751f2

I was able to knit the instructor's hw1.Rmd without error.

I had error with Git on my mac as desktop is considered a folder.  Some things that would make Git/GitHub easier is making the names simple and having more labels.
