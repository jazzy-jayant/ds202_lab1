## Knit the instructorâ€™s hw1.Rmd. Are you able to do so without error? If you cannot, what errors did you counter?
I was able to do so without error

## Also include an error/difficulty you encountered, or a tip for making Git/GitHub easier.
To make using git easier you can use both the command line, and the website or desktop app, since sometimes it is nice to see a visual representation of what has changed with each new commit. A difficulty that I had encountered was trying to pull from the remote when the remote had something different from my local repository as the local did not want to merge with the remote repository.
