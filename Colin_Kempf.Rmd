The first commit,"Create README", was to create the README and include text.
It's ID is: 5b20e6e3c657e5a6e6ab1c99d28e84b9efc78366

The second commit, "Update README", added a blank line between two spaces.
It's ID is: 7958af1beeaf537c8136cda7b4d1f2bc5e806550

No errors when knitting.

I did not encounter any difficulties on the assignement. I am not super familiar with github to know what could be improved. I guess if the ID's for commits were shorter or more clearly identifiable, that might help.
