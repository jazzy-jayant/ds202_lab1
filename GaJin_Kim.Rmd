What did the instructor do in the first two commits? What are the commit IDs?

First Commit: Created ReadMe (clone id: 5b20e6e3c657e5a6e6ab1c99d28e84b9efc78366). States if you're working individually, push your files to this repository.
Second Commit: Updates ReadMe (clone id: 7958af1beeaf537c8136cda7b4d1f2bc5e806550). Adds an empty line.
```

```
Knit the instructorâ€™s hw1.Rmd. Are you able to do so without error? If you cannot, what errors did you counter?

No Errors.
```

```
Also include an error/difficulty you encountered, or a tip for making Git/GitHub easier.
